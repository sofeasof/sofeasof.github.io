### Assignment 1- UTM Digital Industry Visit
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Summary | From the industrial visit, I gained valuable exposure to how digital technology is applied in real industrial and organization environments. I had the opportunity to explore various company booths such as Microsoft Copilot, Canon, Microcorp, Dron Malaysia (Axis) and many more. Each booth showcased different technological solutions that are currently being used to improve productivity, efficiency, and innovation in the industry. This visit somehow broadened my understanding of how theoretical knowledge learned in class connects with real-world industrial applications, especially in the areas of digital transformation, automation, and smart technologies.|
| Improvement Suggestion | -More time at each booth would allow students to ask deeper questions and better understand the technologies being presented. | 
|   | - Arrange the talk based on the course specification. As a graphic student, I wish that our team were assigned to the Microsoft Copilot's talk so that we are exposed to the industry that are related to our speciality. |
| Other Reflection | This industrial visit motivated me to think more seriously about my future career path, especially in technology- related fields. Seeing how different companies apply digital solutions in practical settings made me realize the importance of continuously improving both technical skills and soft skills, such as communication and adaptability. |


### Lab 1- PC Assemble
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Summary | I found that hands-on experience in building computer from scratch helped me understand better about the practical aspects of computer hardware. I learned how each components; such as the CPU, motherboard RAM, storage devices, power supply, and cooling systems work together to form a fully functional system. This lab also strenghtened my compability of components, and experience with troubleshooting issues, like identifying loose connections. |
| Improvement Suggestion | -Provide a common errors and solutions in advance so that it would help students handle assembly issues with confidence. |
| Other Reflection | This lab session encouraged me to develop a problem-solving skills, as minor mistakes during assembly required careful observation and testing to fix. It also taught me to be patience, have a careful attention to detail, and following step-by-step procedures, which are essential not in just assembling PCs but in any technical task. |


### Assignment 2- PPG
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Summary | PPG Industry Talk provided valuable insights into pratical applications of PPG-related field like paint technology, coatings, and industrial processes in the industry. The talk highlighted how companies apply research, innovation, and technology to develop products and solutions that meet market demands. I learned about the various career opportunities in the industry and the essential skills required, such as technical knowledge, problem-solving, teamwork, and communicatio. The speaker also shared real-life examples of projects and challenges faced by professionals, which gave me a clearer understanding of how theoretical concepts learned in class are applied in practice. |
| Improvement Suggestion | -A live demonstration or visual examples could help students better understand the complex industrial process. |
| Other Reflection | The talk inspired me to consider how innovation drives industry growth and the importance of combining technical skills with creativity. It also motivated me to develop my professional skills early, such as effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are valued in the workplace. |


### Design Thinking- TaskSync
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Summary | Working on the Design Thinking project for TaskSync allowing me to experience the full process of developing a low-fidelity prototype from ideation to visualization. Through this project, I learned how to apply the design thinking methodology effectively, including stages such as emphatizing with users, defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and creatign simple prototypes. Building the low-fidelity prototype helped me understand the importance of visualizing ideas before implementation. It emphasized how even a basic sketch, wireframe, or clickable mockup can communicate concepts clearly to team members and potential users. This experience strengthened my skills in user-centered design, collaboration, and iterative thinking.|
| Improvement Suggestion | -Clearer time allocation so that more time for brainstorming and user research would help the team explore diverse ideas and refine the prototype further. |
| Other Reflection | This project heleped ,e develop a problem-solving mindset and a better understanding of team collaboration, as every member contributed ideas and suggestions. It also highlighted the importance of rapid prototyping and testing in design thinking, where small, simple models can reveal potential issues before investing time and resources into final product. |
